# LibraryMngSys-using-Spring
Simple Library Management System implemented using Spring Boot. 

Dependencies used: Spring Web, Lombok, Spring Validation, MySQL Driver, JPA

Backend: used Spring JPA to map Model objects to tables in MySQL DB.

Note: Didn't use Spring Security in this project so avoided having an Admin entity.
